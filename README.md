üöÄ Installation
----------------

First you will need to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NateShoffner/lanco-discord-bot
```

Next, go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application. Create a bot for the application and copy the token. You will need to add the bot to your server using the OAuth2 URL generated in the portal.

Copy the `.env.default` file and create a `.env` file with your bot token and other settings including the SQLite database path.

The other API keys are optional depending on what cogs you want to enable.

You'll need to install the dependencies using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

```bash
cd lanco-discord-bot
poetry install
```

After installing the dependencies, you can run the bot using the following command:

```bash
poetry run python app/main.py
```

### üê≥ Docker

Alternatively, you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run the bot via `docker-compose`.

Cogs are generally disabled by default. Please refer to the [cogs](app/cogs) directory for more information on how to use them.

‚öôÔ∏è Cog Development
-------------------

All features are implemented as cogs in the [cogs](app/cogs) directory.

To create a new cog, create a new folder in the [cogs](app/cogs) directory with the name of your cog and an entrypoint script within it with the same name as the folder.

```bash
mkdir app/cogs/yourcog
touch app/cogs/yourcog/yourcog.py
```

All cogs should inherit from the [LancoCog](app/cogs/lancocog.py) class.

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
from cogs.lancocog import LancoCog

class YourCog(LancoCog, name="YourCog", description="Your cog description."):

    def __init__(self, bot: commands.Bot):
        super().__init__(bot)

async def setup(bot):
    await bot.add_cog(YourCog(bot))
```
