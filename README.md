‚öôÔ∏è Cog Development
-------------------

To create a new cog, create a new folder in the [cogs](app/cogs) directory with the name of your cog and an entrypoint script within it with the same name as the folder.

```bash
mkdir app/cogs/yourcog
touch app/cogs/yourcog/yourcog.py
```

All cogs should inherit from the [LancoCog](app/cogs/lancocog.py) class.

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
from cogs.lancocog import LancoCog

class YourCog(LancoCog, name="YourCog", description="Your cog description."):

    def __init__(self, bot: commands.Bot):
        super().__init__(bot)

async def setup(bot):
    await bot.add_cog(YourCog(bot))
```
